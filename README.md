# AlbumListKotlin - Recommendations for future development

Use more detailed api so a matching image can be displayed with the album.

More detailed api so the user with an onClickListener can click on the album in the list and be moved to a details page with additional information e.g. artist name, release date etc.

Add a button or swipeRefreshLayout so the user can update the information displayed at anytime.

Add a search filled so the user can search for a specific album.

Add a window with checkboxes so the user can filter the list e.g. Genre, release date, etc.

Creating a favourites tab where users could save the albums they like would be good, to avoid having the users have to scroll through a long list to find the albums they like.
